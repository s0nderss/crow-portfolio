        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>i've been a hobby artist for much of my life. as a hobby artist, i wanted to have an online portfolio where i could showcase my work, and through that i found web development. i found that i really enjoyed coding, and started self-teaching. though, i found that i didn't do very well with the lack of structure, and so i became a student at thinkful!</p>

        <p>i also really enjoy studio ghibli movies. here are some of my favorites in order!</p>
        <ol>
          <li>spirited away</li>
          <li>howl's moving castle</li>
          <li>ponyo</li>
          <li>kiki's delivery service</li>
        </ol>
        <p>these movies feel like home, because i grew up watching a lot of them.</p>

        <p>if you're looking for a new hire, or someone to bounce coding ideas off of, feel free to contact me! i am incredibly excited to build a network and meet other devs.</p>
